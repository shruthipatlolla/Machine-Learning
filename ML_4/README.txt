# Assignment 4
In this assignment you will take your data set and create new features and then split the data frame into a training and test set.

## Introduction
Refer to the Data Splitting slides.  Look at the note book in the Sample Analysis directory under csis-machine-learning. 
  

## What to do
Modify the Assignment4 note book by adding in code sections to finish the tasks listed.
## Submission
### Process:  There are multiple parts to the assignment. Fill in the code and notes sections associated with each part.  You should not need to add in extra sections, but if you feel the need, do so.   
### Commit and Push
Anytime you complete a part, you are required to commit to your local personalized copy of the repository. You will then push to the github repository.  Use good commit messages.  _Points will be deducted if you don't commit for each part._  Note:  It is always acceptable to make a change to a section later. Just remember to commit and push your work.
