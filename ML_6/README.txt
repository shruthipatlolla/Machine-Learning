# Assignment 6
In this assignment you will take a data set that has three categories where you decide if a scale is balanced.  This data set comes from UCI (Univerisity of California Irivine) Machine Learning data sets.  It is a good source to be aware of.

## Introduction
Refer to the Decision Tree slides.  Look at the note book in csis-machine-learning
1. decision_tree_iris in the Sample Analysis directory
  

## What to do
Modify the Assignment6 note book by finishing the tasks listed in the code and mark down sections.
## Submission
### Process:  There are multiple parts to the assignment. Fill in the code and notes sections associated with each part.  You should not need to add in extra sections, but if you feel the need, do so.   
### Commit and Push
Anytime you complete a part, you are required to commit to your local personalized copy of the repository. You will then push to the github repository.  Use good commit messages.  _Points will be deducted if you don't commit for each part._  Note:  It is always acceptable to make a change to a section later. Just remember to commit and push your work.
