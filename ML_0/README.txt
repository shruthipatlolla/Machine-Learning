# Programming Assignment 0 for Machine Learning Spring 2019
Our initial programming assignment in machine learning

## Introduction
Open the Introduction to Python notebook in the DS-Python repository _URL_ with Spyder.  Try running the chunks of code and then explore.  The more that you ask questions and try things out the faster you will become comfortable in Python.   As you are playing with the notebook, you should also double click on text sections to expose the MarkDown.  You will be asked to intersperse description and code as we move forward in the course. MarkDown is a handy tool to format text (simpler than HTML).  Also, since it is text based, it will integrate well with git.  Here is a handy online reference to the formatting you can do with it.
