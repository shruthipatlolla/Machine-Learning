# Assignment 1
This is an asssignment on the basics of Python.

## Introduction
Open the Introduction to Python notebook in the DS-Python repository _URL_ with Spyder.  Try running the chunks of code and then explore.  The more that you ask questions and try things out the faster you will become comfortable in Python.   As you are playing with the notebook, you should also double click on text sections to expose the MarkDown.  You will be asked to intersperse description and code as we move forward in the course. MarkDown is a handy tool to format text (simpler than HTML).  Also, since it is text based, it will integrate well with git.  Here is a handy online reference to the formatting you can do with it.

## What to do
Modify the Assignment1 note book by adding in code sections to finish the tasks listed.
## Submission
### Process:  There are multiple parts to the assignment. You will insert a code section after each part where you will put your answer.
(You might also be asked to insert a MarkDown section as well.) 
### Commit and Push
Anytime you complete a part, you are required to commit to your local personalized copy of the repository. You will then push to the github repository.  Use good commit messages.  _Points will be deducted if you don't commit for each part._  Note:  It is always acceptable to make a change to a section later. Just remember to commit and push your work.
